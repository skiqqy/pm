# Pass

This repo contains scripts that I use to update and backup my passwords

## Reason for own repo

Normally I keep helper scripts in my [bin](https://github.com/skiqqy/bin) repo
but I have plans one day to implement my own password manager, and when that day
comes I will host it in this repo, alongside its helper scripts.
